# Directed_Graph
This program implements a valued directed graph using dijkstra.


## Commands

- ```R``` - READING: reads a text file [(file.txt)](file.txt) containing the graph definition.
- ```N``` - NEIGHBORHOOD: shows the neighborhood set of a vertex read from the keyboard.
- ```S``` - DEGREE SEQUENCE: shows the sequence of degrees of the graph.
- ```D``` - DIJKSTRA: shows the shortest path (according to the DIJKSTRA algorithm) between the source vertex and the target vertex read (if there is a path between them).
- ```E``` - EXIT: ends the program.
